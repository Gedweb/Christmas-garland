# Christmas lights HA

The project is based on WS2812FX WLED which allows to integrate your Christmas lights with a Home Assistant via Wi-Fi.

The integration provides an ability to modify animation modes, speed, color and brightness. 

There is a rainbow regime for any mode and also a random regime that will switch modes at rates (higher values means more frequently).
